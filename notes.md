# Want to support N players

360 / N = Angle you have to yourself
Increase circle size as N increases proportionally
Move paddles in the circle

# TODO
[x] Draw a circle in the background as a guide
[ ] Move paddles along a circle
[ ] Shoot ball in random direction
[ ] Have ball wait for 1 second before shooting out
[ ] Support more than 2 players (but don't worry about their movement for now)
